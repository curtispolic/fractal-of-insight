# Fractal of Insight
A Grand Archive TCG tournament analysis site

This site shows information and analysis of Grand Archive tournament results. It uses the Omnidex API, which is beta and subject to change without notice, in a way that is officially unsupported but hopefully OK with Weebs of the Shore.

## TODO / Planned Features

- (partly done) improved visual styles overall
- allow filtering in season event list too
- (partly done) mobile-friendly tooltip alternative
    - works ok in player list, not so much in match list.
- refine archetype classification
    - require card combos or density (i.e. % allies or % resemblance to a predefined list)
    - use machine-learning clustering to identify archetypes?
- display archetype definitions to users
- archetype overlap chart
- archetype overall winrate stats
- champion/class stats
- fix overlay effect for deck view (click shaded area should close, controls shouldn't scroll)
- handle team standard format (separately?)
- add ability to sideload decklists (e.g. for old events)
- add player profiles across events?
- make dynamic sections, i.e. flask app or something, for showing individual events
- stats on most-used cards, etc.
